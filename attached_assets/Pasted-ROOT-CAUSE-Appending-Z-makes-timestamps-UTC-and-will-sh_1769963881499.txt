ROOT CAUSE
Appending "Z" makes timestamps UTC and will shift date/time when parsed by Date(), especially around midnight.
Any usage of:
- "Z" suffix
- Date.toISOString()
- new Date(isoStringWithZ)
will reintroduce the day rollover bug.

TASK
Fix fingerprint handling with a strict "NO TIMEZONE" rule:
- Treat all attendance datetimes as local wall-clock values.
- Store them as plain components and compare using numeric seconds, NOT Date objects.

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

1) REMOVE all server/backend logic
- Delete or completely bypass server/routes.ts and /api/import/punches usage.
- Fingerprint import must run entirely in the browser.

2) Data representation (single source of truth)
For each punch row store ONLY:
- employeeCode: string
- punchDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- punchTime: "HH:mm:ss"
- punchDateTimeKey: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"   (NO timezone, NO Z)
- punchSeconds: number (0..86399) derived from punchTime
Optionally:
- punchSortKey: `${punchDate}|${punchSeconds}` or number for sorting
DO NOT store JS Date objects as the main truth.

3) Parsing rules (must not shift days)
A) Excel serial datetime numbers:
- Convert using serial math WITHOUT Date() timezone conversion:
  - daySerial = floor(serial)
  - timeFraction = serial - daySerial
  - Convert daySerial to YYYY-MM-DD using Excel 1900 date system
  - Convert timeFraction to seconds = round(timeFraction * 86400)
  - seconds -> HH:mm:ss
B) Text datetime like "16/12/2025 12:06 AM":
- Parse as dd/MM/yyyy
- Convert 12h clock to 24h correctly
- Output punchDate + punchTime exactly

4) Grouping and min/max
- Group by (employeeCode, punchDate)
- Check-in = min(punchSeconds)
- Check-out = max(punchSeconds)
Never group by Date() or timestampMs derived from timezone-affected parsing.

5) UI and exports
- Display punchDate/punchTime directly.
- When exporting to Excel:
  - Write date and time as Excel-typed cells:
    - date: Excel date number or Date constructed carefully from components WITHOUT timezone shift
    - time: number fraction (seconds/86400)
  - Do NOT write ISO strings with Z.

6) Tests (must be added/updated)
- A punch at "16/12/2025 00:06" must remain punchDate=2025-12-16, punchTime=00:06:00
- Ensure no output contains 'Z' anywhere.
- Ensure check-in/out for midnight punches matches the old behavior.
