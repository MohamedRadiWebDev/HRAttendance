TASK
Fix the fingerprint import so that the parsed datetime values preserve the ORIGINAL expected format and types used by the system before the Friday feature and before the new parser.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT
Fingerprint Excel headers are exactly:
- "كود"
- "التاريخ_والوقت"

PROBLEM
After the new parser, you normalize datetime in a way that breaks how attendance calculations and Excel exports behave (e.g., times appear as strings/ISO, wrong locale, wrong day/month, wrong time format, or Excel cells no longer behave as true date/time).

REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1) Preserve value types (Excel-like behavior)
- Internally, store punch datetime as a real Date object (JS Date) AND also store:
  - punchDateKey: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  - punchTimeValue: a numeric Excel-time fraction OR a stable "HH:mm:ss" string
- Do NOT store only ISO strings in a way that breaks sorting/comparisons.
- All comparisons (min/max punches) must be done using Date timestamps, not string compare.

2) Restore ORIGINAL display format used previously in the UI + exports
- Wherever the system shows or exports time fields derived from punches (check-in/out, first/last stamp):
  - They must render exactly like before (e.g., "HH:mm" or "HH:mm:ss" — match existing UI and template).
  - They must export as real Excel date/time cells, not plain text.

3) Excel export cell typing (CRITICAL)
When generating .xlsx:
- Dates must be written as Excel date cells (type = number with date format) or as Date objects supported by your Excel writer library.
- Times must be written as Excel time cells (number = fraction of day) with a time format like "hh:mm" or "hh:mm:ss".
- Do NOT write ISO text for date/time cells unless the original template expects text.
- Keep the template’s number formats where applicable.

4) Parsing rules (do not change headers or mapping)
- employee_code = value under "كود" (stringify, trim)
- punch_datetime = value under "التاريخ_والوقت"
- Handle:
  A) Excel datetime cells (numbers): convert using Excel serial rules and timezone-safe logic
  B) Text datetime cells: parse robustly for formats like "16/12/2025 12:06 AM"
- IMPORTANT: Ensure day/month parsing is correct for dd/MM/yyyy (Egypt style), not MM/dd.

5) Backward compatibility
- The same fingerprint file that worked before must produce identical check-in/check-out results and identical exported attendance sheet cell types/formatting.

6) Verification steps you MUST do
- Upload the provided fingerprint file (البصمة.xlsx) and verify:
  - check-in/out computed correctly (earliest/latest)
  - UI shows correct times (no ISO strings)
  - exported Excel opens with correct date/time cells (Excel recognizes them; you can change format in Excel and it behaves like a real time/date)
- Add/adjust unit tests:
  - Excel serial datetime parsing
  - dd/MM text parsing
  - export cell type assertions (date/time must not be strings)

DO NOT
- Do not add any Friday/sector logic into fingerprint parsing.
- Do not require master data for fingerprint upload.
- Do not alter attendance penalty logic.
