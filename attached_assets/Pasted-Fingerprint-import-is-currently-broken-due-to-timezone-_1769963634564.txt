Fingerprint import is currently broken due to timezone conversion.

EVIDENCE
Parsed rows show punchDatetime in UTC (ending with Z) and punchDate shifts by +1 day:
Example:
- punchDatetime: 2025-12-15T22:06:00.000Z
- punchDate: 2025-12-16
This indicates the parser converts Excel/local datetime to UTC and then derives date/time, causing day rollover.

TASK
Fix fingerprint parsing so that Excel datetimes are treated as "local wall-clock" times and DO NOT shift dates due to timezone.

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS
1) Never store punchDatetime as a UTC-Z string.
2) Preserve the exact date+time as appears in Excel:
   - If Excel shows 16/12/2025 12:06 AM then internal representation must keep:
     punchDate = 2025-12-16
     punchTime = 00:06:00
     and punchDatetime (if stored) must be a "local" datetime, not UTC.

3) Parsing Rules
A) If the cell is an Excel serial datetime number:
   - Convert using Excel serial -> local date/time components WITHOUT timezone shifting.
   - Derive components via serial math:
     - datePart = floor(serial)
     - timePart = serial - floor(serial)
     - Convert datePart to YYYY-MM-DD using Excel epoch rules
     - Convert timePart to HH:mm:ss by multiplying by 24*60*60
   - Build punchDate and punchTime from these components.

B) If the cell is text datetime (e.g. "16/12/2025 12:06 AM"):
   - Parse as dd/MM/yyyy format (Egypt style), not MM/dd
   - Produce punchDate and punchTime exactly as written.

4) Data Model Output
For each punch row store:
- employeeCode (string)
- punchDate (YYYY-MM-DD)  [PRIMARY for grouping]
- punchTime ("HH:mm:ss")  [PRIMARY for sorting within day]
- punchDateTimeKey ("YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss") as a plain local key string (NO timezone / NO Z)
Optionally:
- punchTimestampMs computed from punchDateTimeKey assuming local time, used only for comparisons.
But do NOT output ISO with Z.

5) Grouping & Min/Max
- When computing earliest/latest per employee/day:
  - compare using punchTime seconds OR punchTimestampMs built from local key
  - NEVER compare ISO strings with Z.

6) UI + Export
- Display and export must use punchDate/punchTime without any timezone adjustments.
- Excel export should write times as real Excel time cells if the rest of the system expects that.

7) Verification
Using the provided fingerprint file:
- Ensure no punchDate shifts to the next day due to UTC conversion.
- A punch at 00:06 stays on the same date in punchDate.
- Check-in/out per day match previous version behavior.

DELIVERABLE
Patch the fingerprint parser to remove UTC conversion and preserve Excel/local wall-clock datetime.
Add unit tests for:
- Excel serial datetime at midnight cases (00:xx) to ensure no day rollover
- dd/MM text datetime parsing
